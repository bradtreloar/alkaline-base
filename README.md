# Alkaline Theme for Drupal

Alkaline is a general-purpose theme for Drupal.

## HTML DOM structure

Alkaline extends Drupal's basic system of components to include
a library of Semantic HTML widgets and a flexible layout system

### Page Layout

Alkaline composes pages with the following structure:

```html
<body>
  <div class="page">
    <div class="layer">
      <div class="region">
        <div class="block">
          <!-- block content -->
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
```

`block` components may be hardcoded into the template or they may be generated by Drupal's `block` module.

Alkaline overrides the `region` template used by the `stable` theme with an empty template that
only renders the `block` components in the `region`. The `region` tags must be hardcoded into
the `page` template or the `region` template must be overridden.

`panel` is primarily intended as a extra layout helper (e.g. to provide a centre-aligned, 
max-width wrapper), which is why they are optional.

'layer' represents separate parts of the page (e.g. header, main, footer)

### Content and Widgets

Alkaline places all content and widgets inside `block` components. This includes `branding`
and `menu` components, and small standalone elements like `page_title` and `breadcrumb`.

This allows page layout to be decoupled from content layout and widget styling: the page layout
system is unconcerned with the contents of `block` components, and the Block contents are 
unconcerned with anything outside their own Block.

## CSS

Alkaline's CSS is written in SASS and organised in the following structure:

```
base/                 normalisation
  _typography.scss      font imports
  _reset.scss           remove browser default rules
  _default.scss         apply theme's default rules
vars/                 SASS variables available to components
  _colors.scss          a map of colours and functions to fetch them
  _metrics.scss         a list of global variables (e.g. $contentMaxWidth)
helpers/              mixins and abstract classes available to components
  _media.scss           mixin to simplify @media blocks
  _layout.scss          grid and alignment mixins
  _style.scss           rich-text abstract class;
layout/
  
components/           all components
  _block.scss
  _region.scss
  _panel.scss
  _layer.scss
  _page.scss
  _button.scss
  _menu.scss
  _form.scss
  _table.scss
  ...etc
```

It is similar to the SMACSS style guide, except that all state-dependent rules
are written in the files belonging to the components they apply to, and there is
no need for for a theme folder since Drupal handles theme-switching.
